		<h2>Polar bears</h2>
		
		<h3>
		
		Polar bears hold the title of being the largest bear species worldwide and occupy the apex position in the Arctic's food chain. 
		These remarkable creatures are renowned for their exceptional swimming prowess, distinctive white fur, and ability to thrive in harsh environments. 
		Their remarkable adaptations, including specialized paws, a substantial layer of body fat, and water-resistant fur, enable them to maintain a steady pace of up to six miles per hour. 
		These adaptations serve as insulation, safeguarding them from the frigid water and atmosphere prevalent in their habitat.
		<br>
		<br>
		Polar bears devote more than half of their time to hunting, primarily targeting ringed and bearded seals to acquire the substantial fat reserves necessary for their survival. 
		In addition to their distinctive predatory behavior, polar bears have successfully adapted to one of the most unforgiving environments on our planet. 
		They heavily rely on sea ice for various essential activities, including travel, hunting, resting, mating, and occasionally 
		creating maternal dens (World Wildlife Fund, n.d.).

		<h2>Sloth bears</h2>
		
		<h3>Despite their name implying similarities to sloths, sloth bears are quite the opposite. 
		These remarkable animals possess impressive speed and agility, surpassing that of humans. 
		Their appearance is characterized by a coarse and disorderly coat of fur that extends over their ears, shoulders, 
		and neck. Unlike other bear species, sloth bears are unique in their behavior of carrying their young on their backs. 
		Additionally, their shaggy coat serves as a form of defense against termites, which happen to be their preferred 
		source of nourishment.</h3>
